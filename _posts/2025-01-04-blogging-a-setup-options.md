## Different Blogging Platform Types
- **Static Site Generators (SSG)** Generates static HTML files from markdown files. Themes/templates are used to define the HTML view.
- **Content Management Systems (CMS)** Platforms like WordPress or Drupal dynamically generate pages using a database.
- **Hosted Blogging Platforms** Fully managed platforms where hosting and maintenance are handled by the provider.

| **Integration with Tools** | Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines and development tools                 | Extensive integration via plugins, APIs, and themes                              | Limited integrations; platform-specific apps may be available           |

## Which Option for Which User ?
